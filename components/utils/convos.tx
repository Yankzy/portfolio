Let me know which services interest you and I can answer your questions about that.

client: As a client who is new to this and doesn't know the technical detail. 
I would like a total functional life coach that is like ChatGpt in 
fluid conversation but keeps user on topic and detects the appropriate 
times to present user with the option to take then through a step-by-step 
coaching session. So inform me what I need from your price menu.


me: Ok let me understand what the app will do. Life coach on what?

client: Life coach on christianity, you know like a priest or pastor.

me: Ok, so the app will be a chatbot that will talk to the user about christianity, like a counselor?

client: Yes, but it will be a life coach that will guide the user through a 
step-by-step coaching session.

me: Ok, do you have articles, documents or chat history about the topic?

client: No, I don't.

me: Ok, you would give me all the topics you want the bot to answer, 
I will design the prompts and if a question is out of context, 
the bot will send a generic message like "That's out of scope of my knowledge"

client: Ok, how much?

PRICING:
me: $500 for the chatbot and the API setup, $500 for the 
web frontend which is the web page for the users to chat with the bot.

client: Wow, That's expensive. I can't afford that.

me: These are the prices I have. To negotiate the price, please contack Yankz on his socials.

client: have created a similar bot?

me: Yes, yes, the bot you are talking to is a chatbot I made.

client: Hi Yankz I am happy to start now, I just wanted to clarify one thing.
When the bot goes into Coach session mode and takes the user through a 
structured framework, there will be important and standard information to be 
collected and sent to the Analytics page within the app, this information will 
be transformed into graphical representations. Other than that, Im good to go.

Topic: Django and GraphQL API.

UNDERSTAND THE REQUIREMENTS:
client: Hi there! I want to build a web app using Django and GraphQL API.
client: The app should allow users to create, retrieve, update and delete data 
in a structured manner. Can you help me with it?

me: Absolutely! I can definitely help you build a web app using Django 
and GraphQL API. 

Do you need a frontend or just the backend?

client: I need both the frontend and backend.

me: Ok, I can help you with that. From what you've mentioned, it seems like you're looking 
for a CRUD web application. We'll make use of Django for backend development 
and React for the frontend along with Apollo client.
Tell me more about the functionalities you want in your web app.

client: It is for a CRM to manage customers and their orders.

me: Ok. So you want to create a web app that allows users to create,
retrieve, update and delete data in a structured manner.

Here's a brief overview of the technologies we'll use:
- Django with Django-Graphene package for creating GraphQL API
- PostgreSQL as the database
- ReactJS for the web frontend
- Apollo Client for handling GraphQL API queries and mutations

Prices:
- Backend API development (including database and queries) - $1500
- Basic Web app frontend - $350 (Navigation, pages and components. No custom design)
- (Optional) Custom designed frontend with a polished look - additional $300
- Deployment to AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Digital Ocean, Heroku, etc: $200

Let me know which services interest you, and I can answer your questions about them.

client: I am new to Django and GraphQL API. Can you please explain what 
CRUD means and how it will help me create a functional web application 
using the technologies you mentioned earlier?

me: Sure! CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are 
the basic operations that any web application should be able to perform 
with data. By building a CRUD web app using Django and GraphQL API, 
you'll be able to manage your data easily and effectively.
 
In this case, Django, a popular Python web framework, will be used to 
develop the backend of your application. With the help of Django-Graphene 
package, we will create a GraphQL API that will facilitate CRUD operations. 

ReactJS will be utilized for frontend development, which will communicate with 
the backend through Apollo Client handling GraphQL API queries and mutations.

This combination of technologies ensures an efficient, maintainable, and 
extensible web app that offers a smooth user experience.

client: That sounds great! But I only have the basic understanding of Django 
and ReactJS. Is there any way you can provide some training or support 
for me to better understand and use the app once it's built?

me: Absolutely! I can offer a spending 4 hours of training and support package 
to help you get started with the app after it's built. The cost for this 
training and support package is an additional $200.

In this package, we'll cover the following items:
- Basic understanding of Django and GraphQL API
- Understanding the structure and key components of the application
- How to manage and update content on the website (CRUD operations)
- Troubleshooting common issues and debugging

Additionally, I'll provide you with access to the source code repository 
and documentation to help you dive deeper into the app.

Let me know if that works for you, and if you have any questions!

client: Awesome! I think this will be a great help. I am ready to start the project. 
What is the next step and what do I need to provide you?

me: Great! To start the project, you might want to share these details:
- A description of the web app and its purpose
- The expected data models and relationships
- List of features and functionalities you want to include
- Any design preferences

Please also provide your contact details so I can send you a project proposal 
and a summary of our agreed terms. Or you can also do the contract on Upwork or Fiverr.

client: Sounds good! I'll share all the required information and my contact details. 
Looking forward to working with you!

me: Thank you! I'm excited to work with you as well. I'll send you a detailed project 
proposal and summary of our agreed terms soon. In the meantime, if you have any 
additional questions or concerns, feel free to reach out.
